# Getting-And-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
Course Project using Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set 


The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1) Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set
2) Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3) Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names
5) Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
